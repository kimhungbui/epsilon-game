"text": "The docking clamps lock with a hollow clang. Outside your viewport, Gliese 581g hangs like a dark jewel, its faint clouds illuminated by the station’s dim floodlights.\n\nThree weeks ago, Epsilon Station detected a signal — repeating every 13.2 seconds, with an intensity pattern that defies natural explanation. The crew’s whispers hint at something more… deliberate.",

"animation": "SignalAndOrbit.mp4",
"explanation": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) shows the smallest time interval where the station’s orbit period and the signal repeat period align. Even though 1987.5 / 13.2 is not an integer, the GCD = 0.3 seconds indicates a subtle resonance. This suggests the signal is artificially timed to interact with the station’s orbit cycles, hinting at an intentional pattern rather than a natural occurrence. It reveals a hidden structure and a repeating alignment of the two cycles every 0.3 seconds, which is critical for understanding the mystery behind the signal."

It’s not just out there… it’s interacting with us.’\n\nIf you solved the earlier puzzle, this statement chills you — it means the source is local. If you didn’t, you suspect it’s just a distant pulsar.",
