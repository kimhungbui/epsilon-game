Its period is just seconds, yet the pattern feels deliberate. Outside, the city sleeps, unaware of the mysterious rhythms detected by the instruments.",

"text": "The docking clamps lock with a hollow clang. Outside your viewport, Gliese 581g hangs like a dark jewel, its faint clouds illuminated by the station’s dim floodlights.nnThree weeks ago, Epsilon Station detected a signal — repeating every 13.2 seconds, with an intensity pattern that defies natural explanation. The crew’s whispers hint at something more… deliberate. The hum of life support and faint creaks of the metal hull underscore the isolation of the orbiting outpost.",

"text": "Banks of monitors show the signal as jagged peaks. The technician hands you a tablet with two numbers highlighted: Station orbit period = 1987.5 seconds. Signal repeat = 13.2 seconds. The screens flicker, casting erratic shadows across the metallic walls, enhancing the sense of unease.nnThe question: Are these harmonically related, or is the timing purely coincidental?",

"animation": "gcd_periodicity.mp4",
"explanation": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) shows the smallest time interval where the station’s orbit period and the signal repeat period align. Even though 1987.5 / 13.2 is not an integer, the GCD = 0.3 seconds indicates a subtle resonance. This suggests the signal is artificially timed to interact with the station’s orbit cycles, hinting at an intentional pattern rather than a natural occurrence. It reveals a hidden structure and a repeating alignment of the two cycles every 0.3 seconds, which is critical for understanding the mystery behind the signal. Imagine two waves, one representing the orbit, the other the signal, intersecting every 0.3 seconds — that is the hidden rhythm the station detects."

The feeling of discovery sends a shiver down your spine.nnThis changes everything. You mark the result in your log and begin triangulating the signal’s source, aware that something or someone is deliberately sending messages that align with the station’s own movements.",

"text": "The chief engineer leans in close, voice low: ‘The signal’s amplitude matches fluctuations in our power core output. It’s not just out there… it’s interacting with us.’ The lights flicker slightly as if the station itself is responding.nnIf you solved the earlier puzzle, this statement chills you — it means the source is local and intentionally interacting with the station’s systems. If you didn’t, you suspect it’s just a distant pulsar, yet an uneasy feeling lingers in the pit of your stomach.",
